Traditionally it encompasses cultural activities in the fields of Italian architecture, painting and sculpture during the period 1500-1600. The cinquecento witnessed the full flowering of High Renaissance art - in Rome, Venice, and to a lesser extent Florence - as well as the related Mannerism movement which followed. The High Renaissance paintings in Rome were dominated by masterpieces from the three geniuses Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, and Michelangelo. For instance, Leonardo's matchless portrait art, Raphael's perfect compositions of harmony and balance, and Michelangelo's magnificent religious paintings on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel are considered some of history's finest pieces of art.
