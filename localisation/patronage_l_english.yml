  patronage_of_the_arts_EVTDESC00001:0 "The Early Renaissance art focused on realism, which was in line with the Humanism ideals prevalent during this cultural shift in European history. There was more naturalism in art. Figures were depicted with more anatomical realism and emotive qualities versus the two-dimensionality of the earlier Byzantine Art. Artists also included new illusionistic techniques like chiaroscuro and trompe l'oeil that contributed to the overall three-dimensionality of artworks. We should perhaps consider investing in the early renaissance art. Investing in art will improve our cultural identity and attract merchants from far and beyond to invest into our country.

This realism is also applied to the religious imagery or iconography. Moreover, the Flemish primitives emphasise a previously unseen religious expressivity that ushers in a new tradition in painting. The commissions not only came from the various courts and religious institutions, but also from the cities and their citizenry. For the first time, the painter received a very prominent position in the society. We can choose between Jan Van Eyck and Rogier Van der Weyden to create our next masterpiece."
