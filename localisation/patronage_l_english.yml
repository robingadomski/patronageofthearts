  patronage_of_the_arts_EVTDESC00001:0 "The Early Renaissance art focused on realism, which was in line with the Humanism ideals prevalent during this cultural shift in European history. There was more naturalism in art. Figures were depicted with more anatomical realism and emotive qualities versus the two-dimensionality of the earlier Byzantine Art. Artists also included new illusionistic techniques like chiaroscuro and trompe l'oeil that contributed to the overall three-dimensionality of artworks. We should perhaps consider investing in the early renaissance art. Investing in art will improve our cultural identity and attract merchants from far and beyond to invest into our country.

This realism is also applied to the religious imagery or iconography. Moreover, the Flemish primitives emphasise a previously unseen religious expressivity that ushers in a new tradition in painting. The commissions not only came from the various courts and religious institutions, but also from the cities and their citizenry. For the first time, the painter received a very prominent position in the society. We can choose between Jan Van Eyck, Rogier Van der Weyden, and Dirk Bouts to create our next masterpiece."

He lived in a very urban society, and grew to believe that the city was a necessary component of civilization. For this reason, he argued architecture was among the most notable of art forms. His focus on ancient Greece and Rome led him to study the Classical architectural orders. In particular, he obsessed over Vitruvius' De Architectura, the only surviving work of the great Roman architectural theorist. \n \n So, what exactly was in De re Aedificatoria? Alberti's focus was on the art of building, both in terms of single buildings and entire urban spaces. He explores this through three focuses, based closely on the three fundamentals of building outlined by Vitruvius, called the Vitruvian Triad. First is the stability and usefulness of a structure. Next are the aesthetic elements of lines, angles, and proportions. Finally are the elements of beauty and ornamentation. In basic terms, a great structure must be stable/useful, aesthetically pleasing, and well decorated. We are now going to build a magnificent church based on Alberti's plans!"

The two are linked not only by the use of a painted golden frame structure in the picture (not found, or not yet found, in any other surviving works by Rogier), but also in the style of the underdrawing. Both works may have been created at roughly the same time, and the dating of the triptych to around 1445, on dendrochronological evidence, would support that theory. Certainly the designs of both pictures derive from Rogier himself, but his assistants seem to have been involved in the execution, and perhaps did some of the preparatory underdrawing as well. The figures of the triptych are executed to a very high standard. However, they seem more abstract and graphic and less three-dimensional than those in the great Deposition (Prado, Madrid), the Madonna in Red (Prado, Madrid), and the Miraflores Altarpiece (Staatliche Museen, Berlin). There is less play of light and shade, and although the landscape is crisscrossed by many rocky crevices and paths, it seems rather empty.

Nothing is known about the origins of the painting, neither the commissioner nor the place for which the altarpiece was intended. The work was not threatened by the destruction during the Wars of Religion, which were around Touraine around 1562 and which may explain the few religious works by Fouquet that have been preserved. The painting was rediscovered in 1911 by Paul Vitry, curator of sculpture at the Louvre Museum."

The king liked to have non-aristocrats such as Chevalier about him because he thought them more reliable than nobles. On his right is Chevalier's patron saint, St. Stephen, in a dark deacon's robes with gold trim. His right arm is draped across Chevalier's shoulder while his left hand holds a book and a jagged rock, his representational attribute as he was stoned to death. Both men gaze off to the right as if they were looking at the Virgin and child on the other panel. The wall behind the treasurer and his patron saint is inlaid with marble panels and has elaborate white and gold moldings. The tiled floor's neutral colors create a stark contrast with the saturated colors of the men's robes. Identifying Chevalier is an engraving on the wall behind him that says "IER ESTIEN". This lettering has been used to link the painting to Fouquet since he never signed any of his work. It is very similar to lettering used in several miniatures which are attributed to him."

Because of the many miracles attributed to his intercession, he is also known as Nicholas the Wonderworker. Saint Nicholas is the patron saint of sailors, merchants, archers, repentant thieves, children, brewers, pawnbrokers, unmarried people, and students in various cities and countries around Europe. His reputation evolved among the pious, as was common for early Christian saints, and his legendary habit of secret gift-giving gave rise to the traditional model of Santa Claus ('Saint Nick') through Sinterklaas. Little is known about the historical Saint Nicholas. The earliest accounts of his life were written centuries after his death and probably contain legendary elaborations. He is said to have been born in the Greek seaport of Patara, Lycia, in Asia Minor to wealthy Christian parents."

For a long time, the master headed an art artel consisting of clergymen. They helped him to create religious masterpieces. In 1502-1503, the work on the painting 'Descent to Hell' was finished in the icon painter's studio, Dionosius. The central figure of the painting is the image of Jesus Christ himself. To his right and left are ancestors and prophets. Angels winding around, piercing the bodies of demons. They symbolize the victory of the best qualities of man over his filth and vices. Angels are also located at the bottom of the composition. Next to them are people resurrected after death. Complements the image of the cross. The picture is made in dark, heavy colors.

He depicted a key scene in the Christian tradition in a completely new manner. The focus of the strict composition now shifts to the figure of Jesus, which expresses suffering and redemption. Unlike preiconoclastic images that included a greater number of characters, Dionysius's icon concentrates on three figures; Jesus Christ, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and John the Theologian. It also features three women standing next to the Virgin, one of whom embraces her. Besides, the Crucifixion icon created by Dionysius does not depict the Roman soldiers and thieves who, according to legend, were crucified with Christ. Previously, these figures had always been included in the icon composition. One can also see angels hovering over the Crucifixion. The skull and bones of Adam are depicted beneath the foot of the cross. The image of Christ does not express hatred but rather suffering along with serenity."

It has been housed in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, Spain since 1939. As little is known of Bosch's life or intentions, interpretations of his artistic intent behind the work range from an admonition of worldly fleshy indulgence, to a dire warning on the perils of life's temptations, to an evocation of ultimate sexual joy. The intricacy of its symbolism, particularly that of the central panel, has led to a wide range of scholarly interpretations over the centuries. Twentieth-century art historians are divided as to whether the triptych's central panel is a moral warning or a panorama of paradise lost."

  patronage_of_the_arts_bruegelDESC1:0 "The painting shows a panorama of an army of skeletons wreaking havoc across a blackened, desolate landscape. Fires burn in the distance, and the sea is littered with shipwrecks. A few leafless trees stud hills otherwise bare of vegetation. Fish lie rotting on the shores of a corpse-choked pond. Art historian James Snyder emphasizes the scorched, barren earth, devoid of any life as far as the eye can see. In this setting, legions of skeletons advance on the living, who either flee in terror or try in vain to fight back. In the foreground, skeletons haul a wagon full of skulls. In the upper left corner, others ring the bell that signifies the death knell of the world. People are herded into a coffin-shaped trap decorated with crosses, while skeletons on horseback kill people with a scythe. This is one of four horses ridden by skeletons that are depicted in the painting, probably alluding to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The painting depicts people of different social backgrounds - from peasants and soldiers to nobles as well as a king and a cardinal - being taken by death indiscriminately."

Running themes in Bruegel's paintings that appear in Netherlandish Proverbs are the absurdity, wickedness and foolishness of humans. Its original title, The Blue Cloak or The Folly of the World, indicates that Bruegel's intent was not just to illustrate proverbs, but rather to catalogue human folly. Many of the people depicted show the characteristic blank features that Bruegel used to portray fools. His son, Pieter Brueghel the Younger, specialised in making copies of his father's work and painted at least 16 copies of Netherlandish Proverbs.[2] Not all versions of the painting, by father or son, show exactly the same proverbs and they also differ in other minor details."

According to Stabius's explanation on the Arch of Honour, the symbolism behind the pomegranate is like this, although a pomegranate's exterior is neither very beautiful nor endowed with a pleasant scent, it is sweet on the inside and is filled with a great many well-shaped seeds. Likewise the Emperor is endowed with many hidden qualities which became more and more apparent each day and continue to bear fruit. Maximilian wears a gown with a very wide fur collar and a broad-brimmed dark hat, with a brooch in the center.

An imaginary line from Jerome's head passing through the cross would arrive at the skull on the window ledge, as if contrasting death and the Resurrection. The lion in the foreground is part of the traditional iconography of St. Jerome, and near it is a sleeping dog, an animal found frequently in Dürer's works, symbolizing loyalty. Both creatures are part of Jerome's story in the Golden Legend (c. 1260), which contained fanciful hagiographies of saints. St. Jerome in His Study is often considered as part of a group of three Dürer engravings (his Meisterstiche), the other two being the well-known Melencolia I (1514) and Knight, Death and the Devil (1513). Together they have been viewed as representing the three spheres of activity recognized in medieval times; Knight, Death, and the Devil belongs to the moral sphere and the 'active life'; Melencolia I represents the intellectual; and St. Jerome the theological and contemplative life."

Below, the human multitudes are divided between religious men and women (left, led by the pope), and laymen, led by the Holy Roman Emperor—a division similar to that already adopted by Dürer in the Feast of the Rosary (1506). At left, near a cardinal who is perhaps interceding for him, is the aged Matthäus Landauer, wearing rich garments and putting down his hat. A peasant, with one of his tools, represents the poor classes. On the right is an enigmatic queen whose face is entirely hidden by a veil, which leaves only the eyes visible."
